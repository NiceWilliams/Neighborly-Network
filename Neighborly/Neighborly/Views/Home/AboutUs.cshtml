<h1>The Neighborly Network Story</h1>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<div><p>Neighborly Network was founded in 2019 for the purpose of providing members of smaller
    communities with a platform that they can utilize to inform locals of numerous resources and 
     various activities that they may participate in.  Wether it's a "Food Drive" or a "Festival" 
     Neighborly Network is here to connect neighbors with their neighbors!
